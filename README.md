<h1>https://runamoto.github.io/experimental-film-generator/</h1>
<p></p>A series of experimental short clips and audio made in collaboration with Zaid Irfan for his fictional screenplay. This interplay of sounds and visuals made entirely from scratch using arbitrary items and tools was an attempt to use sound and sight to inspire. Instead of specifying the system in full details you only specify somewhat, and then you ride in the directions of the system in the direction you want to go, this is a completely different way of making art, and I wanted to archive it in a way that would allow for a charming and "unique" experience for every onlooker. The aim of the website is to get lost in the laying of sounds and visuals; to create your own experimental filmâ€” sort of like those poster generator everyone makes when they graduate undergrad, but with a slightly different passion.</p>
